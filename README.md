# My Web Portfolio Development Process
## Process

To create my web portfolio for my video studio, I started by brainstorming the overall design and layout of the website. I wanted to make sure it looked professional and visually appealing, while also highlighting some of my best work. From there, I created a sitemap and wireframes to help me visualize the different pages and content that I wanted to include. Once I had a clear plan in place, I started designing and building the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also made sure to optimize the website for SEO and mobile responsiveness.

## Challenges

One of the challenges I faced was finding the right balance between design and functionality. I wanted my website to look visually appealing, but I also wanted to make sure it was easy to navigate and provided visitors with all the information they needed. To overcome this challenge, I made sure to test the website with different users and get feedback on the design and functionality.

## Learnings

Creating my web portfolio for my video studio taught me a lot about web development and design. I learned the importance of having a clear plan and strategy in place before starting to build the website. I also learned how to balance design and functionality to create an effective user experience. Additionally, I learned the importance of testing and getting feedback from users to continuously improve the website. Overall, creating my web portfolio was a great learning experience and helped me develop new skills in web development and design.
